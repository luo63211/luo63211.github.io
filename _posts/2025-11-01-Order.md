description: Self-Proof is a narrative and puzzle solving game based on my own stories. <br> The player acts as a beautiful woman who calls herself a wretch. From an appointment, she steps into the edge and depths of her dreams, conversing with the mind and objects. Gradually, she discovers a profound disconnection between her real memories from the past and her current self-perception. She struggles against these contradictions through self-proof, only to find that the “errors” are quietly merging and connecting with her memories, aided by her mind.Her memories are being rewritten, moment by moment. <br>When memory and language can no longer be trusted, the only thing left to define the essence of a person, is choice.

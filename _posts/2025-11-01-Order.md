description: Order is a puzzle board game inspired by ancient Greek mathematical aesthetics. It experimentally explores new mechanics derived from straightedge and compass construction, inheriting the logic-driven spirit of Sudoku. Players use a pencil, a ruler without measuring and a compass to explore the proportions of ancient architecture, admire the beauty of rose window designs, immerse in the logic and elegance of geometry. They will confront new rules and even dive into detective adventures.
